# The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for graph coloring

# main  
While running this code, you have two options:
1) Import matrix from file
2) Generate an Erdos-Renyi matrix

Finding the best coloring of an input graph can be done by running 
the "Test different values of Q as a function of C". We have also included
the "Test different functions section", which is where we experimented 
with the different cooling schedules.
